This project is Done In MATLAB :)

Using This Project We could detect Brain Tumor we just have to Upload The Image to The Progarm GUI and after processing we get the diagnosis 

Firstly anisotropic filtering is applied to the image to reduce noice and make the edges more sharp

After Ansiotrophic Filtering The Image is converted to grey scale (8-Bit) 

after converting the image to greyscale we Check the solidity of every part of Image As tumors have relatively 'High Solidity' Than it's Surrounding

After That Morphological Operations are applied to the processed image and we  get Border of Tumor (if present)
